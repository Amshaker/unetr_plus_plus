> **Abstract:** *Owing to the success of transformer models, recent works study their applicability in 3D medical segmentation tasks. Within the transformer models, the self-attention mechanism is one of the main building blocks that strives to capture long-range dependencies. However, the self-attention operation has quadratic complexity which proves to be a computational bottleneck, especially in volumetric medical imaging, where the inputs are 3D with numerous slices.  In this paper, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation approach, named UNETR++, that offers both high-quality segmentation masks as well as efficiency in terms of parameters, compute cost, and inference speed. The core of our design is the introduction of a novel efficient paired attention (EPA) block that efficiently learns spatial and channel-wise discriminative features using a pair of inter-dependent branches based on spatial and channel attention.
Our spatial attention formulation is efficient having linear complexity with respect to the input sequence length. To enable communication between spatial and channel-focused branches, we share the weights of query and key mapping functions that provide a complimentary benefit (paired attention), while also reducing the overall network parameters. Our extensive evaluations on five benchmarks, Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, BRaTs, and Decathlon-Lung, reveal the effectiveness of our contributions in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. On Synapse, our UNETR++ sets a new state-of-the-art with a Dice Score of 87.2%, while being significantly efficient with a reduction of over 71% in terms of both parameters and FLOPs, compared to the best method in the literature.*

## Architecture overview of UNETR++
Overview of our UNETR++ approach with hierarchical encoder-decoder structure. The 3D patches are fed to the encoder, whose outputs are then connected to the decoder via skip connections followed by convolutional blocks to produce the final segmentation mask. The focus of our design is the introduction of an _efficient paired-attention_ (EPA) block. Each EPA block performs two tasks using parallel attention modules with shared keys-queries and different value layers to efficiently learn enriched spatial-channel feature representations. As illustrated in the EPA block diagram (on the right), the first (top) attention module aggregates the spatial features by a weighted sum of the projected features in a linear manner to compute the spatial attention maps, while the second (bottom) attention module emphasizes the dependencies in the channels and computes the channel attention maps. Finally, the outputs of the two attention modules are fused and passed to convolutional blocks to enhance the feature representation, leading to better segmentation masks.

## Qualitative Comparison

### Synapse Dataset
Qualitative comparison on multi-organ segmentation task. Here, we compare our UNETR++ with existing methods: UNETR, Swin UNETR, and nnFormer. 
The different abdominal organs are shown in the legend below the examples. Existing methods struggle to correctly segment different organs (marked in red dashed box). 
Our UNETR++ achieves promising segmentation performance by accurately segmenting the organs.

Qualitative comparison on the ACDC dataset. We compare our UNETR++ with existing methods: UNETR and nnFormer. It is noticeable that the existing methods struggle to correctly segment different organs (marked in red dashed box). Our UNETR++ achieves favorable segmentation performance by accurately segmenting the organs.  Our UNETR++ achieves promising segmentation performance by accurately segmenting the organs.
